# Christopher Von Wilczur's Frontend-Nanodegree-Feedreader

This project was intended to show experience in writing tests using Jasmine for a pre-existing app. I wrote several tests to determine the functionality of several features of the app.

## Installing/Running

* Download the repo from Github as a .zip file onto your local machine
* Unzip the repository
* Open the index.html file in your browser
* Ideally, you should now have the FeedReader visible
* To switch between feeds, use the hamburger menu in the top left of the screen
* To follow through to a blog, click on the title in the feed

### Dependencies

* Jasmine 2.1.2 (JS Testing)
* Normalize (CSS)
* jQuery (JavaScript framework)
* Handlebars.js (JavaScript templating)
* Google JavaScript API

## Running the tests

The tests will automatically run once the index.html file is loaded. All tests should show as green, testing for:
* RSS feeds being defined, having URLs and names
* The menu starting hidden and displaying/hiding when clicked
* Initial entries loading onto the page
* New content loading when a different feed is selected
